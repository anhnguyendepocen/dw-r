# Managing Vectors {#managing_vectors}

The basic structure in R is the vector.  A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type: [integer](#integer_vs_double), [double](#integer_vs_double), logical, or [character](#character_basics). ^[There are two additional vector types which I will not discuss - complex and raw.]
