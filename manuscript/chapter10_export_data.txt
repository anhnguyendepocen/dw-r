# Exporting Data
Although getting data into R is essential, getting data out of R can be just as important. Whether you need to export data or analytic results simply to store, share, or feed into another system it is generally a straight forward process. This section will cover how to export data to text files, Excel files (along with some additional formatting capabilities), and save to R data objects. In addition to the the commonly used base R functions to perform data importing, I will also cover functions from the popular `readr` and `xlsx` packages along with a lesser known but useful `r2excel` package for Excel formatting.

## Writing data to text files
As mentioned in the importing data section, text files are a popular way to hold and exchange tabular data as almost any data application supports exporting data to the CSV (or other text file) formats.  Consequently, exporting data to a text file is a pretty standard operation. Plus, since you've already learned how to import text files you pretty much have the basics required to write to text files...we just use a slightly different naming convention. 

Similar to the examples provided in the importing text files section, the two main groups of functions that I will demonstrate to write to text files include base R functions and `readr` package functions.

## Base R functions
`write.table()` is the multipurpose work-horse function in base R for exporting data.  The functions `write.csv()` and `write.delim()` are special cases of `write.table()` in which the defaults have been adjusted for efficiency.  To illustrate these functions let's work with a data frame that we wish to export to a CSV file in our working directory.


```r
df <- data.frame(var1 = c(10, 25, 8), 
                 var2 = c("beer", "wine", "cheese"), 
                          var3 = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
                 row.names = c("billy", "bob", "thornton"))

df
##          var1   var2  var3
## billy      10   beer  TRUE
## bob        25   wine  TRUE
## thornton    8 cheese FALSE
```
