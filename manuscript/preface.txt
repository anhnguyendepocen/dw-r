# Preface

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! In this book, I will help you learn the essentials of preprocessing data leveraging the R 
programming language to easily and quickly turn noisy data into usable pieces of information. Data wrangling, which is also 
commonly referred to as data munging, transformation, manipulation, janitor work, etc. can be a painstakenly laborious process.
In fact, its been stated that up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data.  [^fn-first_footnote]
However, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, analysis, reporting), it's essential 
that you become fluent *and* efficient in data wrangling techniques.

This book will guide you through the data wrangling process along with give you a solid foundation of the basics of working
with data in R. My goal is to teach you how to easily wrangle your data, so you can spend more time focused on understanding
the content of your data via visualization, analysis, and reporting. By the time you finish reading this book, you will have 
learned how to work with the different data types, acquire and parse data from locations you may not have been able to 
access before, develop your own functions, manage control structures, reshape the layout of your data, and manipulate, summarize,
and join data sets.  In essence, you will have the data wrangling toolbox required for modern day data analysis.
