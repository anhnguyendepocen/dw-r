# Preface

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! In this book, I will help you learn the essentials of preprocessing data leveraging the R 
programming language to easily and quickly turn noisy data into usable pieces of information. Data wrangling, which is also 
commonly referred to as data munging, transformation, manipulation, janitor work, etc. can be a painstakenly laborious process.
In fact, its been stated that up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data[^fn-first_footnote].
However, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, modeling, reporting), it's essential 
that you become fluent *and* efficient in data wrangling techniques.

This book will guide you through the data wrangling process along with give you a solid foundation of the basics of working
with data in R. My goal is to teach you how to easily wrangle your data, so you can spend more time focused on understanding
the content of your data via visualization, modeling, and reporting your results. By the time you finish reading this book, you will have learned how to work with the different data types and structures, acquire and parse data from locations you may not have been able to access before, develop your own functions, manage control structures, reshape the layout of your data, and manipulate, summarize, and join data sets.  In essence, you will have the data wrangling toolbox required for modern day data analysis.


## Who this Book is For
This book is meant to establish the baseline R vocabulary and knowledge for the primary data wrangling processes.  This captures a wide range of programming activities which covers the full spectrum from understanding basic data objects in R to writing your own functions, applying loops, and webscraping.  As a result, this book can be beneficial to all levels of R programmers.  Beginner R programmers will gain a basic understanding of the functionality of R along with learning how to work with data using R.  Intermediate and/or advanced R programmers will likely find the early chapters reiterating established knowledge; however, these programmers will benefit from the mid and latter chapters by learning newer and/or more efficient data wrangling techniques.  


## What You Need For this Book
Obviously to gain and retain knowledge from this book it is highly recommended that you follow along and practice the code examples yourself.  Furthermore, this book assumes that you will actually be performing data wrangling in R; therefore, it is assumed that you have or plan to have R installed on your computer. You will find the latest version of R for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows at [cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).  It is also recommended that you use an integrated development environment (IDE) as it will simplify and organize your coding environment greatly.  There are several to choose from; however, I highly recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
