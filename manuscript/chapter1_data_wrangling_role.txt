# The Role of Data Wrangling

> *"Water, water, everywhere, nor any a drop to drink"* - Samuel Taylor Coleridge


Synonymous to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's quote in *Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, the degree to which data are useful is largely determined by an analysts ability to wrangle data.  In spite of advances in technologies for working with data, analysts still spend an inordinate amount of time obtaining data, diagnosing data quality issues and pre-processing data into a usable form.  Research has illustrated that this portion of the data analysis process is the most tedious and time consuming component; often consuming 50-80% of an analyst's time[^elephant].  Despite the challenges, data wrangling remains a fundamental building block that enables visualization and statistical modeling. Only through data wrangling can we make data *useful*. Consequently, ones ability to perform data wrangling processes effectively and efficiently is fundamental to becoming an expert data analyst in their respective domain.

So what exactly is this thing called *data wrangling*?  Its the ability to take a messy, unrefined source of data and wrangle it into something useful. Its the art of using computer programming to extract raw data and creating clear and actionable bits of information for your analysis. Data wrangling is the entire front end of the analytic process and requires numerous tasks that can be categorized within the *get*, *clean*, and *transform* components.

However, learning how to wrangle your data does not follow a linear progression as suggested by the above figure. In fact, you need to start from scratch to understand how to work with data in R.  Consequently, this book takes a meandering route through the data wrangling process to help build a solid data wrangling foundation. 

First, modern day data wrangling requires being comfortable writing code. If you are new to writing code, R or RStudio you need to understand some of the basics of working in the "command line" environment. The next chapter in this section walks you through the process of assigning and evaluating expressions, the idea of vectorization, how to get help, managing your workspace, and how to work with packages. Lastly, I offer some basic styling guidelines to help you write code that is easier to digest by others.
