# The Role of Data Wrangling

> *"Water, water, everywhere, nor any a drop to drink"* - Samuel Taylor Coleridge


Synonymous to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's quote in *Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, the degree to which data are useful is largely determined by an analysts ability to wrangle data.  In spite of advances in technologies for working with data, analysts still spend an inordinate amount of time obtaining data, diagnosing data quality issues and pre-processing data into a usable form.  Research has illustrated that this portion of the data analysis process is the most tedious and time consuming component of the analytic process; often consuming 50-80% of an analyst's time[^elephant].  Despite the challenges, data wrangling remains a fundamental building block that enables visualization and modeling. Only through data wrangling can we make data *useful*. Consequently, ones ability to perform data wrangling processes effectively and efficiently is foundational to becoming an expert data analyst in their respective domain.

Data wrangling is the ability to take a messy or unrefined source of data and wrangle it into something useful. When wrangling data, you seek raw data sources and determine their value and use for your research. Once the datasets are usable, you can utilize tools and methods (like a Python script) to help you analyze and present your findings in a report. This allows you to take data no one would bother looking at and make it both clear and actionable.
