-# Working with Different Types of Data in R

R is a flexible language that allows you to work with many different *forms* of data. This includes numeric, character, categorical, dates, and logical. Technically, R classifies all the different types of data into five classes:

- integer
- numeric
- character
- complex
- logical

Modern day analysis typically deals with every class so its important to gain fluency in dealing with these data forms.  This section covers the fundamentals of handling the different data classes.  First I cover the basics of dealing with [numbers](#numbers) so you understand the different classes of numbers, how to generate number sequences, compare numeric values, and round. I then provide an introduction to working with [characters](#characters) to get you comfortable with character string manipulation and set operations.  This prepares you to then learn about [regular expressions](#regex) which deals with search patterns for character classes. I then introduce factors, also referred to as categorical variables, and how to create, convert, order, and re-level this data class. Lastly, I cover how to manage [dates](#dates) as this can be a persnickety type of variable when performing data analysis.  Throughout several of these chapters you'll also gain an understanding of the `TRUE`/`FALSE` logical variables.
