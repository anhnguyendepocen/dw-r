# Dealing with Character Strings
Dealing with character strings is often under-emphasized in data analysis training.  The focus typically remains on numeric values; however, the growth in data collection is also resulting in greater bits of information embedded in character strings.  Consequently, handling, cleaning and processing character strings is becoming a prerequisite in daily data analysis.  This chapter is meant to give you the foundation of working with characters by covering some [basics](#character_basics) followed by learning how to [manipulate strings](#string_manipulation) using base R functions along with using the simplified `stringr` package.  Next you will learn the basics of identifying, extracting, and replacing patterns in character strings commonly referred to as [regular expressions](#regex). Lastly, I offer some [additional resources](#add_resources) to learn more about dealing with characters and expressions.
