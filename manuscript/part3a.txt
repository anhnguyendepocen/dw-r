-# Managing Data Objects in R

> *"Witty quote here"*

The basic data structures in R can be organized by their dimensionality (1D, 2D, ..., *n*D) and their "likeness" (homogenous vs. heterogeneous).  This results in five data structure types most often used in data analysis; and almost all other objects in R are built from these foundational types:

I have not had the need to use multi-dimensional arrays, therefore, the topics I will go into details on will include the vector, list, matrix, and data frame.  These types represent the most commonly used data structures for day-to-day analyses.
