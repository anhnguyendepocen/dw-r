# Dealing with Dates
Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years.  R has a range of functions that allow you to work with dates and times.  Furthermore, packages such as [`lubridate`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) make it easier to work with dates and times.

In this chapter I will introduce you to the basics of dealing with dates.  This includes printing the [current date and time](#current_date_time) stamp, [converting strings to dates](#date_convert), [extracting and manipulating parts of dates](#date_extract), [creating date sequences](#date_seq), performing [calculations with dates](#date_calc), and dealing with [time zone and daylight savings differences(#date_time_zone).  I end with offering [additional resources](#date_addtl) to learn and deal with date and time data.
