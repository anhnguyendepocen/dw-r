# Dealing with Dates
Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years.  R has a range of functions that allow you to work with dates and times.  Furthermore, packages such as [`lubridate`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) make it easier to work with dates and times.

In this chapter I will introduce you to the basics of dealing with dates.  This includes printing the [current date and time](#current_date_time) stamp, [converting strings to dates](#date_convert), [extracting and manipulating parts of dates](#date_extract), [creating date sequences](#date_seq), performing [calculations with dates](#date_calc), and dealing with [time zone and daylight savings differences(#date_time_zone).  I end with offering [additional resources](#date_addtl) to learn and deal with date and time data.


## Getting current date & time {#current_date_time}
To get current date and time information:

{linenos=off}
```r
Sys.timezone()
## [1] "America/New_York"

Sys.Date()
## [1] "2015-09-24"

Sys.time()
## [1] "2015-09-24 15:08:57 EDT"
```


If using the `lubridate` package:

{linenos=off}
```r
library(lubridate)

now()
## [1] "2015-09-24 15:08:57 EDT"
```


## Converting strings to dates {#date_convert}
When date and time data are imported into R they will often default to a character string.  This requires us to [convert strings to dates](#date_convert_strings).  We may also have multiple strings that we want to [merge to create a date variable](#date_merge_strings).  


### Convert Strings to Dates {#date_convert_strings}
To convert a string that is already in a date format (YYYY-MM-DD) into a date object use `as.Date()`:

{linenos=off}
```r
x <- c("2015-07-01", "2015-08-01", "2015-09-01")

as.Date(x)
## [1] "2015-07-01" "2015-08-01" "2015-09-01"
```

Note that the defaul date format is YYYY-MM-DD; therefore, if your string is of different format you must incorporate the `format` argument.  Note that there are multiple formats that dates can be in; for a complete list of formatting code options in R type `?strftime` in your console.

{linenos=off}
```r
y <- c("07/01/2015", "07/01/2015", "07/01/2015")

as.Date(y, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
## [1] "2015-07-01" "2015-07-01" "2015-07-01"
```


If using the `lubridate` package:

{linenos=off}
```r
library(lubridate)
ymd(x)
## [1] "2015-07-01 UTC" "2015-08-01 UTC" "2015-09-01 UTC"

mdy(y)
## [1] "2015-07-01 UTC" "2015-07-01 UTC" "2015-07-01 UTC"
```

One of the many benefits of the `lubricate` package is that it automatically recognizes the common separators used when recording dates ("-", "/", ".", and "").  As a result, you only need to focus on specifying the order of the date elements to determine the parsing function applied:

### Create Dates by Merging Data {#date_merge_strings}
Sometimes your date data are collected in separate elements.  To convert these separate data into one date object incorporate the `ISOdate()` function:

{linenos=off}
```r
yr <- c("2012", "2013", "2014", "2015")
mo <- c("1", "5", "7", "2")
day <- c("02", "22", "15", "28")

# ISOdate converts to a POSIXct object
ISOdate(year = yr, month = mo, day = day)
## [1] "2012-01-02 12:00:00 GMT" "2013-05-22 12:00:00 GMT"
## [3] "2014-07-15 12:00:00 GMT" "2015-02-28 12:00:00 GMT"

# truncate the unused time data by converting with as.Date
as.Date(ISOdate(year = yr, month = mo, day = day))
## [1] "2012-01-02" "2013-05-22" "2014-07-15" "2015-02-28"
```
Note that `ISODate()` also has arguments to accept data for hours, minutes, seconds, and time-zone if you need to merge all these separate components.
