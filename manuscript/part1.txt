Data.  Our world has become increasingly reliant upon, and awash in, this resource.  Businesses are increasingly seeking to capitalize on data analysis as a means for gaining competitive advantages[^one].  Government agencies are using more types of data to improve operations and identify efficiencies[^two].  Sports entities are increasing the range of data applications, from how teams are using data and analytics[^three] to how data is impacting the experience for the fan base[^four]. Journalism has increased the role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information as evidenced by the emergining field of data journalism[^five].  In fact, the need to work with data has become so prevalent that the U.S. alone is expected to have a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 data analysts by 2018[^six].


In addition, the U.S. General Services Administration now provides access to over 180,000 data sets to provide organizations, academics, and individuals resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, etc[^xxxx].

[^five]: This is evidenced by the popularity of such data journalism productions such as [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), [UpShot](http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/?_r=0), and [Vox](http://www.vox.com/).  This [USAToday article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/16/data-journalism-on-the-rise/6424671/) further articulates this emerging demand.
