-# Introduction

> *"With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more."* - Mortimer J. Adler

Data.  Our world has become increasingly reliant upon, and awash in, this resource.  Businesses are increasingly seeking to capitalize on data analysis as a means for gaining competitive advantages[^one].  Government agencies are using more types of data to improve operations and efficiencies[^two].  Sports entities are increasing the range of data applications, from how teams are using data and analytics[^three] to how data is impacting the experience for the fan base[^four]. Journalism has increased the role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information as evidenced by the emergining field of data journalism[^five].  In fact, the need to work with data has become so prevalent that the U.S. alone is expected to have a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 data analysts by 2018[^six].  Consequently, it is safe to say there is a need for becoming fluent with the data analysis process.  

Fluency in data analysis captures a wide range of activities.  At its most basic structure, data analysis fluency includes the ability to get, clean, transform, visualize, and model data as depicted in the following illustration.

From project to project, no analytic process will be the same. Each specific instance of data analysis includes unique, different, and often multiple requirements regarding the specific processes required for each stage. For instance, getting data can include simply accessing an Excel file, scraping data from an HTML table, or using an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to access a database.  Cleaning data can include reshaping data from a wide to long format, parsing variables, and/or transforming variables to different formats.  Transforming data can include filtering, summarizing, and applying common/uncommon functions to data along with joining multiple datasets.  Visualizing data can range from common static exploratory data analysis plots to dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.  And modeling data can be even more diverse covering the range of [descriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics), [predictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics), and [prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescriptive_analytics) analytic techniques.

Consequently, the road to becoming an expert in data analysis can be daunting. And, in fact, obtaining expertise in the wide range of data analysis processes utilized in your own respective field is a career long process.  However, the goal of this book is to help you take a step closer to fluency in the early stages of the analytic process.  Why? Because before using statistical literate programming to report your results, before developing optimization or predictive model, before performing exploratory data analysis, before visualizing your data, you need to be able to manage your data. You need to be able to import your data. You need to be able to work with the different data types. You need to be able to subset and parse your data. You need to be able to manipulate and transform your data. You need to be able to *wrangle* your data!
