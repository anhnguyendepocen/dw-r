# Loop Control Statements {#control_structures}

Looping is similiar to creating functions in that they are merely a means to automate a certain multi step process by organizing sequences of R expressions. R consists of several loop control statements which allow you to perform repetititve code processes with different intentions and allow these automated expressions to naturally respond to features of your data. Consequently, learning these loop control statements will go a long ways in reducing code redundancy and becoming a more efficient data wrangler.

This chapter starts by covering the [basic control statements](#loop_functions) in R, which includes `if`, `else`, along with the `for`, `while`, and `repeat` loop control structures.  In addition, I cover `break` and `next` which allow you to further control flow within the aforementioned control statements.
Next I cover a set of vectorized functions known as the [apply family](#apply_family) of functions which minimize your need to explicitly create loops.  I then provide some [additional "loop-like" functions](#other_loops) that are helpful in everyday data analysis followed by a list of [additional resources](#functions_add_resource) to learn more about control structures in R.


## Basic control statements (i.e. `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) {#loop_functions}

### if Statement
The conditional `if` statement is used to test an expression.  If the `test_expression` is `TRUE`, the `statement` gets executed. But if it's `FALSE`, nothing happens. 

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of if statement
if (test_expression) {
        statement
}
```

The following is an example that tests if any values in a vector are negative.  Notice there are two ways to write this `if` statement; since the body of the statement is only one line you can write it with or without curly braces.  I recommend getting in the habit of using curly braces, that way if you build onto if statements with additional functions in the body or add an `else` statement later you will not run into issues with unexpected code procedures.

{linenos=off}
```r
x <- c(8, 3, -2, 5)

# without curly braces
if(any(x < 0)) print("x contains negative numbers")
## [1] "x contains negative numbers"

# with curly braces produces same result
if(any(x < 0)){
        print("x contains negative numbers")
}
## [1] "x contains negative numbers"

# an if statement in which the test expression is FALSE
# does not produce any output
y <- c(8, 3, 2, 5)

if(any(y < 0)){
        print("y contains negative numbers")
}
```

### if...else Statement
The conditional `if...else` statement is used to test an expression similar to the `if` statement.  However, rather than nothing happening if the `test_expression` is `FALSE`, the `else` part of the function will be evaluated. 

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of if...else statement
if (test_expression) {
        statement 1
} else {
        statement 2
}
```

The following extends the previous example illustrated for the `if` statement in which the `if` statement tests if any values in a vector are negative; if `TRUE` it produces one output and if `FALSE` it produces the `else` output.  

{linenos=off}
```r
# this test results in statement 1 being executed
x <- c(8, 3, -2, 5)

if(any(x < 0)){
        print("x contains negative numbers")
} else{
        print("x contains all positive numbers")
}
## [1] "x contains negative numbers"

# this test results in statement 2 (or the else statement) being executed
y <- c(8, 3, 2, 5)

if(any(y < 0)){
        print("y contains negative numbers")
} else{
        print("y contains all positive numbers")
}
## [1] "y contains all positive numbers"
```

Simple `if...else` statements, as above, in which only one line of code is being executed in the statements can be written in a simplified alternative manner.  These alternatives are only recommended for very short `if...else` code:

{linenos=off}
```r
x <- c(8, 3, 2, 5)

# alternative 1
if(any(x < 0)) print("x contains negative numbers") else print("x contains all positive numbers")
## [1] "x contains all positive numbers"

# alternative 2 using the ifelse function
ifelse(any(x < 0), "x contains negative numbers", "x contains all positive numbers")
## [1] "x contains all positive numbers"
```

We can also nest as many `if...else` statements as required (or desired).  For example:

{linenos=off}
```r
# this test results in statement 1 being executed
x <- 7

if(x >= 10){
        print("x exceeds acceptable tolerance levels")
} else if(x >= 0 & x < 10){
        print("x is within acceptable tolerance levels")
} else {
         print("x is negative")
}
## [1] "x is within acceptable tolerance levels"
```

### for Loop
The `for` loop is used to execute repetitive code statements for a particular number of times.  The general syntax is provided below where `i` is the counter and as `i` assumes each sequential value defined (1 through 100 in this example) the code in the body will be performed for that i<sup>th</sup> value.

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of for loop
for(i in 1:100) {
        <do stuff here with i>
}
```

An important lesson to learn is that R is not efficient at *growing* data objects.  As a result, it is more efficient to create an empty data object and *fill* it with the `for` loop outputs.  For example, if you want to create a vector in which 5 values are randomly drawn from a poisson distribution with mean 5, it is less efficient to perform the first example in the following code chunk than to perform the second example.  Although this inefficiency is not noticed in this small example, when you perform larger repetitions it will become noticable so you might as well get in the habit of *filling* rather than *growing*. 

{linenos=off}
```r
# not advised
for(i in 5){
        x <- rpois(5, lambda = 5)
        print(x)
}
## [1] 11  5  8  8  7

# advised
x <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 5)

for(i in 5){
        x <- rpois(5, lambda = 5)
        print(x)
}
## [1] 5 8 9 5 4
```

Another example in which we create an empty matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns.  The `for` loop then iterates over each column (note how *i* takes on the values 1 through the number of columns in the `my.mat` matrix) and takes a random draw of 5 values from a poisson distribution with mean *i* in column *i*:

{linenos=off}
```r
my.mat <- matrix(NA, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for(i in 1:ncol(my.mat)){
        my.mat[, i] <- rpois(5, lambda = i)
}
my.mat
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    0    2    1    7    1
## [2,]    1    2    2    3    9
## [3,]    2    1    5    6    6
## [4,]    2    1    5    2   10
## [5,]    0    2    2    2    4
```

### while Loop
While loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the statement. Once the statement is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth, until the condition is false, after which the loop exits.  It's considered a best practice to include a counter object to keep track of total iterations

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of while loop
counter <- 1

while(test_expression) {
        statement
        counter <- counter + 1
}
```

`while` loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly; therefore, you must use them with care.  To provide a simple example to illustrate how similiar `for` and `while` loops are: 

{linenos=off}
```r
counter <- 1

while(counter <= 10) {
        print(counter)
        counter <- counter + 1
}

# this for loop provides the same output
counter <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 10)

for(i in 1:length(counter)) {
        print(i)
}
```

The primary difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop is:  a `for` loop is used when the number of iterations a code should be run is known where a `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known.  For instance, the following takes value `x` and adds or subtracts 1 from the value randomly until `x` exceeds the values in the test expression.  The output illustrates that the code runs 14 times until x exceeded the threshold with the value 9.

{linenos=off}
```r
counter <- 1
x <- 5
set.seed(3)

while(x >= 3 && x <= 8 ) {
        coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
        
        if(coin == 1) { ## random walk
                x <- x + 1
        } else {
                x <- x - 1
        }
        cat("On iteration", counter, ", x =", x, '\n')
        counter <- counter + 1
}
## On iteration 1 , x = 4 
## On iteration 2 , x = 5 
## On iteration 3 , x = 4 
## On iteration 4 , x = 3 
## On iteration 5 , x = 4 
## On iteration 6 , x = 5 
## On iteration 7 , x = 4 
## On iteration 8 , x = 3 
## On iteration 9 , x = 4 
## On iteration 10 , x = 5 
## On iteration 11 , x = 6 
## On iteration 12 , x = 7 
## On iteration 13 , x = 8 
## On iteration 14 , x = 9
```

### repeat Loop
A `repeat` loop is used to iterate over a block of code multiple number of times. There is test expression in a repeat loop to end or exit the loop. Rather, we must put a condition statement explicitly inside the body of the loop and use the `break` function to exit the loop. Failing to do so will result into an infinite loop.

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of repeat loop
counter <- 1

repeat {
        statement
        
        if(test_expression){
                break
        }
        counter <- counter + 1
}
```

For example ,say we want to randomly draw values from a uniform distribution between 1 and 25.  Furthermore, we want to continue to draw values randomly until our sample contains at least each integer value between 1 and 25; however, we do not care if we've drawn a particular value multiple times.  The following code repeats the random draws of values between 1 and 25 (in which we round).  We then include an `if` statement to check if all values between 1 and 25 are present in our sample.  If so, we use the [`break`](#break) statement to exit the loop.  If not, we add to our counter and let the loop repeat until the conditional `if` statement is found to be true.  We can then check the `counter` object to assess how many iterations were required to reach our conditional requirement.  

{linenos=off}
```r
counter <- 1
x <- NULL

repeat {
        x <- c(x, round(runif(1, min = 1, max = 25)))
        
        if(all(1:25 %in% x)){
                break
        }
                
        counter <- counter + 1
}

counter
## [1] 75
```

### break Function to Exit a Loop
The `break` function is used to exit a loop immediately, regardless of what iteration the loop may be on.  `break` functions are typically embedded in an `if` statement in which a condition is assessed, if TRUE `break` out of the loop, if FALSE continue on with the loop.  In a nested looping situation, where there is a loop inside another loop, this statement exits from the innermost loop that is being evaluated.

{linenos=off}
```r
x <- 1:5

for (i in x) {
        if (i == 3){
                break
                }
        print(i)
}
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
```

### next Function to Skip an Iteration in a Loop
The `next` statement is useful when we want to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it. On encountering next, the R parser skips further evaluation and starts next iteration of the loop.

{linenos=off}
```r
x <- 1:5

for (i in x) {
        if (i == 3){
                next
                }
        print(i)
}
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 4
## [1] 5
```

## Apply family {#apply_family}
The apply family consists of vectorized functions which minimize your need to explicitly create loops.  These functions will apply a specified function to a data object and there primary difference is in the object class in which the function is applied to (list vs. matrix, etc) and the object class that will be returned from the function.  The following presents the most common forms of apply functions that I use for data analysis but realize that additional functions exist (`mapply`,  `rapply`, & `vapply`) which are not covered here. 

### apply() for Matrices and Data Frames
The `apply()` function is most often used to apply a function to the rows or columns (margins) of matrices or data frames. However, it can be used with general arrays, for example, to take the average of an array of matrices. Using `apply()` is not faster than using a loop function, but it is highly compact and can be written in one line.

The syntax for `apply()` is as follows where 

- `x` is the matrix, dataframe or array
- `MARGIN` is a vector giving the subscripts which the function will be applied over. E.g., for a matrix 1 indicates rows, 2 indicates columns, c(1, 2) indicates rows and columns.
- `FUN` is the function to be applied
- `...` is for any other arguments to be passed to the function

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of apply function
apply(x, MARGIN, FUN, ...)
```

To provide examples let's use the mtcars data set provided in R:

{linenos=off}
```r

### lapply() for Lists...Output as a List
The `lapply()` function does the following simple series of operations:

1. it loops over a list, iterating over each element in that list
2. it applies a function to each element of the list (a function that you specify) 
3. and returns a list (the l is for "list").

The syntax for `lapply()` is as follows where 

- `x` is the list
- `FUN` is the function to be applied
- `...` is for any other arguments to be passed to the function

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of lapply function
lapply(x, FUN, ...)
```

To provide examples we'll generate a list of four items:

{linenos=off}
```r
data <- list(item1 = 1:4, item2 = rnorm(10), item3 = rnorm(20, 1), item4 = rnorm(100, 5))

# get the mean of each list item 
lapply(data, mean)
## $item1
## [1] 2.5
## 
## $item2
## [1] 0.5529324
## 
## $item3
## [1] 1.193884
## 
## $item4
## [1] 5.013019
```

The above provides a simple example where each list item is simply a vector of numeric values.  However, consider the case where you have a list that contains data frames and you would like to loop through each list item and perform a function to the data frame.  In this case we can embed an `apply` function within an `lapply` function.  

For example, the following creates a list for R's built in beaver data sets.  The `lapply` function loops through each of the two list items and uses `apply` to calculate the mean of the columns in both list items. Note that I wrap the apply function with `round` to provide an easier to read output.

{linenos=off}
```r
# list of R's built in beaver data
beaver_data <- list(beaver1 = beaver1, beaver2 = beaver2)

# get the mean of each list item 
lapply(beaver_data, function(x) round(apply(x, 2, mean), 2))
## $beaver1
##     day    time    temp   activ 
##  346.20 1312.02   36.86    0.05 
## 
## $beaver2
##     day    time    temp   activ 
##  307.13 1446.20   37.60    0.62
```

### sapply() for Lists...Output Simplified
The `sapply()` function behaves similarly to `lapply()`; the only real difference is in the return value. `sapply()` will try to simplify the result of `lapply()` if possible. Essentially, `sapply()` calls `lapply()` on its input and then applies the following algorithm:

- If the result is a list where every element is length 1, then a vector is returned
- If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (> 1), a matrix is
returned.
- If neither of the above simplifications can be performed then a list is returned

To illustrate the differences we can use the previous example using a list with the beaver data and compare the `sapply` and `lapply` outputs:

{linenos=off}
```r
# list of R's built in beaver data
beaver_data <- list(beaver1 = beaver1, beaver2 = beaver2)

# get the mean of each list item and return as a list
lapply(beaver_data, function(x) round(apply(x, 2, mean), 2))
## $beaver1
##     day    time    temp   activ 
##  346.20 1312.02   36.86    0.05 
## 
## $beaver2
##     day    time    temp   activ 
##  307.13 1446.20   37.60    0.62

# get the mean of each list item and simply the output
sapply(beaver_data, function(x) round(apply(x, 2, mean), 2))
##       beaver1 beaver2
## day    346.20  307.13
## time  1312.02 1446.20
## temp    36.86   37.60
## activ    0.05    0.62
```

### tapply() for Vectors
`tapply()` is used to apply a function over subsets of a vector.  It is primarily used when we have the following circumstances:

1. A dataset that can be broken up into groups (via categorical variables - aka factors)
2. We desire to break the dataset up into groups
3. Within each group, we want to apply a function

The arguments to `tapply()` are as follows:

- `x` is a vector
- `INDEX` is a factor or a list of factors (or else they are coerced to factors) 
- `FUN` is a function to be applied
- `...` contains other arguments to be passed FUN
- `simplify`, should we simplify the result?

{linenos=off}
```r
# syntax of tapply function
tapply(x, INDEX, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)
```

To provide an example we'll use the built in mtcars dataset and calculate the mean of the `mpg` variable grouped by the `cyl` variable.

{linenos=off}
```r

# get the mean of the mpg column grouped by cylinders

Now let's say you want to calculate the mean for *each* column in the mtcars dataset grouped by the cylinder categorical variable.  To do this you can embed the `tapply` function within the `apply` function.  

{linenos=off}
```r
# get the mean of all columns grouped by cylinders 
apply(mtcars, 2, function(x) tapply(x, mtcars$cyl, mean))
##        mpg cyl     disp        hp     drat       wt     qsec        vs
## 4 26.66364   4 105.1364  82.63636 4.070909 2.285727 19.13727 0.9090909
## 6 19.74286   6 183.3143 122.28571 3.585714 3.117143 17.97714 0.5714286
## 8 15.10000   8 353.1000 209.21429 3.229286 3.999214 16.77214 0.0000000
##          am     gear     carb
## 4 0.7272727 4.090909 1.545455
## 6 0.4285714 3.857143 3.428571
## 8 0.1428571 3.285714 3.500000
```
Note that this type of summarization can also be done using the `dplyr` package with clearer syntax.  This is covered in the [dplyr section](#dplyr)*

## Other useful "loop-like" functions {#other_loops}
In addition to the [`apply` family](#apply_family) which provide vectorized functions that minimize your need to explicitly create loops, there are also a few commonly applied `apply` functions that have been further simplified.  These include the calculation of column and row sums, means, medians, standard deviations, variances, and summary quantiles across the entire data set.

The most common apply functions that have been include calculating the sums and means of columns and rows.  For instance, to calculate the sum of columns across a data frame or matrix you could do the following:

{linenos=off}
```r
apply(mtcars, 2, sum)
##      mpg      cyl     disp       hp     drat       wt     qsec       vs 
##  642.900  198.000 7383.100 4694.000  115.090  102.952  571.160   14.000 
##       am     gear     carb 
##   13.000  118.000   90.000
```

However, you can perform the same function with the shorter `colSums()` function and it performs faster:

{linenos=off}
```r
colSums(mtcars)
##      mpg      cyl     disp       hp     drat       wt     qsec       vs 
##  642.900  198.000 7383.100 4694.000  115.090  102.952  571.160   14.000 
##       am     gear     carb 
##   13.000  118.000   90.000
```

To illustrate the speed difference we can compare the performance of using the `apply()` function versus the `colSums()` function on a matrix with 100 million values (10K x 10K).  You can see that the speed of `colSums()` is significantly faster.

{linenos=off}
```r
# develop a 10,000 x 10,000 matrix
mat = matrix(sample(1:10, size=100000000, replace=TRUE), nrow=10000)

system.time(apply(mat, 2, sum))
##    user  system elapsed 
##   1.544   0.329   1.879

system.time(colSums(mat))
##    user  system elapsed 
##   0.126   0.000   0.127
```

Base R provides the following simplified `apply` functions:

* `colSums (x, na.rm = FALSE)`
* `rowSums (x, na.rm = FALSE)`
* `colMeans(x, na.rm = FALSE)`
* `rowMeans(x, na.rm = FALSE)`

In addition, the following functions are provided through the specified packages:

* [`miscTools` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/index.html) (note that these functions will work on data frames)
    * `colMedians()` 
    * `rowMedians()` 
* [`matrixStats` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matrixStats/index.html) (note that these functions only operate on matrices)
    * `colMedians()` & `rowMedians()`
    * `colSds()` & `rowSds()`
    * `colVar()` & `rowVar()`
    * `colRanges()` & `rowRanges()`
    *  `colQuantiles()` & `rowQuantiles()`
    * along with several additional summary statistic functions
  
In addition, the `summary()` function will provide relevant summary statistics over each column of data frames and matrices.  Note in the the example that follows that for the first four columns of the `iris` data set the summary statistics include min, med, mean, max, and 1st & 3rd quantiles.  Whereas the last column (`Species`) only provides the total count since this is a factor variable.

{linenos=off}
```r
summary(iris)
##   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
##  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
##  1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
##  Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300

##  virginica :50
