# Loop Control Statements

> *"To iterate is human, to recurse divine."* - L. Peter Deutsch

Provide introduction here...

In this chapter I will cover the [basic loop functions](#loop_functions) in R.  These loop functions are considered "control structures" because they allow you to control the flow of execution through various logical commands.  Common loop functions that I will cover include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `repeat`.  In addition, I cover `break` and `next` which allow you to further control flow within the aforementioned loop functions.
Next I will cover a set of vectorized functions known as the apply family of functions which minimize your need to explicitly create loops.  I then provide some [additional "loop-like" functions](#other_loops) that are helpful in everyday data analysis followed by a list of [additional resources](#functions_add_resource) to learn more about control structures in R.
