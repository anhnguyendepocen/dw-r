-# Importing, Scraping, and Exporting Data with R {#import_scrape_export}

Data are being generated by everything around us at all times. Every digital process and social media exchange produces it. Systems, sensors and mobile devices transmit it. Countless databases collect it. Data are arriving from multiple sources at an alarming rate and analysts and organizations are seeking ways to leverage these new sources of information. Consequently, analysts need to understand how to *get* data from these data sources.  Furthermore, since analysis is often a collaborative effort analysts also need to know how to share their data.

This section covers the process of importing, scraping, and exporting data. First, I cover the basics of importing tabular and spreadsheet data. Second, since modern day data wrangling often includes scraping data from the flood of web-baseed data becoming available to organizations and analysts, I cover the fundamentals of web-scraping with R. This includes importing spreadsheet data files stored online, scraping HTML text and data tables, and leveraging APIs.  Third, although getting data into R is essential, I also cover the equally important process of getting data out of R. Consequently, this section will give you a strong foundation for the different ways to get your data into and out of R.
